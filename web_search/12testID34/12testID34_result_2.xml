    <head rend="h1">In this NASA image, why does the Earth appear behind the astronaut, as well as reflected in the visor in front of her?</head>
    <head rend="h1">The image in question</head>
    <p>This was taken a few days ago while they were replacing the ISS' Solar Array Batteries.</p>
    <p>A prominent Flat Earther shared the picture, citing the fact that the Earth appears to be both in front and behind the astronaut as proof that this is all some big NASA hoax and conspiracy to hide the true shape of the Earth.</p>
    <p>Of course that's a load of rubbish, but I'm still curious as to why the reflection appears this way!</p>

    <p>Two reasons:</p>
    <p>A. The ISS is at an altitude of approximately 250 miles. At that height, the Earth takes up a HUGE portion of the sky. Take a look for yourself here,</p>

    <p>B. Curved reflective surfaces, like the poly-carbonate visors the astronauts wear, reflect light at wide angles. This is why you can see a warped solar panel (likely not the one behind Astronaut Drew Morgan or Christina Koch) and the helmet light (on the side of the helmet) also in the reflection. That's just how convex mirrors work. The portion of the Earth in the reflection is likely the portion of the Earth visible above the two astronauts out of frame. You'll notice the cloud patterns in the "behind part" do not match the "reflection part".</p>

    <p>If you google "Astronaut Selfie" you'll find that they basically all look like this.</p>

    <p>Here's another one by Aki Hoshide that tries to get the whole Earth in frame.</p>
    <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ISS-32_American_EVA_b3_Aki_Hoshide.jpg</p>
    <p>You'll notice the spacestation is curved in this view and even bits of the helmet are visible in the upper edges like the one you posted.</p>
    <p>While u/AsAChemicalEngineer provided a detailed answer. I’m here to offer hopefully a simpler answer.</p>
    <p>consider this diagram</p>
    <p>The diameter of the Earth is 7,917.5 miles.</p>
    <p>ISS is in orbit about 254 miles above the earth.</p>
    <p>The Earth is massive in comparison to ISS. The Earth is 31x larger than the altitude of the ISS.</p>
    <p>Basically from the angle that the photo is taken, half of the earth is behind the astronaut and the other half is in front. the relection you see is of the half of the earth in front of the astronaut.</p>
    <p>It's the same reason that when you're driving you can see the reflection of the yellow lines on the road on your hood, even though those lines are under the hood.</p>
    <p>You're not seeing the reflection of the lines directly under the car; you're seeing the reflection of the lines that are dozens of yards in front of the car, because those are the lines that are "visible" to the leading surface of your car's curved hood.</p>
    <p>Hey folks - quick solution TURN THE IMAGE UPSIDE DOWN. then you'll see why it looks that way. Here's a quick comp to show you how big the Earth is BELOW the astronaut's helmet:</p>
    <p>https://imgur.com/a/uNTw4Qn</p>
    <p>Imagine you are standing on the streets in front of a huge building, half of it is in front of you and half behind. Now imagine you are also wearing the same reflective helmet like a mirror. A photo of you would show half the building behind you, and also the other half that is in front of you through the mirror reflection.</p>
    <p>A lot of these answers are going straight into the science without mentioning one important thing that's easy to overlook. The photo made sense to me when I realized that the visor is reflecting the other edge of the Earth, the edge that is out of frame, waaay above the picture.</p>
    <p>See how the there's a reflection of that yellow/blue patch? That gives you an idea of how the visor can reflect things at that angle. Now use your finger to roughly trace how big the Earth would be in the photo based on the small curved edge we can see. It's huge, so huge that the visor is able to reflect the top edge of the planet.</p>
    <p>You can see the red solar panel at the top of the photo is also reflected in the visor. So picture the top edge of the Earth in that direction at that sort of angle.</p>
    <p>Edit: Here's an illustration I made for another comment where other people made illustrations too.</p>
    <p>The Earth is ABOVE them, not behind them.</p>
    <p>Your mind pictures the Earth going up beyond the picture, like you're standing in front of something. But it's really gigantic and above them like a ceiling. The reflected part is the other edge of the Earth.</p>
    <p>If you just look at the image in the visor, which is the person in the picture holding on to ISS, while someone else takes the picture, you can put it together easier that the Earth is above them.</p>
    <p>Because the reflective visor is round. It reflects incomming light from ~180° You can see the reflections of both headlights in the visor also. The earth is also not really behind him. Its to the left of him.</p>
    <p>I cant give you as eloquent of an explanation as an explanation as the other people above, but for a flat earther, Im guessing they wont understand it because theyre afraid of curved surfaces /s</p>
    <p>If you look at the angle of the helmet, you can see that the side of the helmet is "parallel" with the surface of earth and the front would would be much closer to perpendicular, so the shortest possible answer is that because the camera is literally using the visor as a perisocope and is pointing at the earth, it may seem confusing because the assumption of the flat earther is probably that the reflection is the same part of the earth as the part behind the astronaught but this is the sameish question as asking "why is the sky in the reflection of this dudes sunglasses and behind him"</p>
    <p>Because earth is huge. You can't see it on this picture, but the visible part of the earth extends behind the person holding the camera. One horizon is reflected on the astronauts visor, which is behind the camera person, and the other horizon is behind the astronaut, likely being reflected in the camera person's visor (we just can't see it).</p>
