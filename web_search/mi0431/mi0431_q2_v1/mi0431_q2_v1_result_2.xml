    <head rend="h1"> ChatGPT is better than DeepSeek, why are people pretending otherwise? </head>
    <p>I imagine its trendy and cool to hate the big guy, or maybe its astroturfing/propaganda.</p>
    <p>But has anyone actually used DeepSeek and got better answers? As much as I want to cancel my subscription, ChatGPT is still the best. Gemini isnt as good. LLaMa is pretty close to ChatGPT. DeepSeek is better than Mistral, but worse than LLaMa.</p>
    <p>"Oh its cheaper"</p>
    <p>I don't care. I need good answers. Cheaper is someone else's job.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT seems best for asking questions about subjects. DeepSeek seems to not know about many subjects and hallucinates.</p>
    <p>I'm curious if anyone has found DeepSeek better than ChatGPT. What was your Application?</p>
    <p>Please provide what ChatGPT you are comparing it to, I typically use ChatGPT4.</p>

    <p>Code generation and debugging.</p>
    <p>Although tbf it's less "better than ChatGPT" and more "I can keep doing this without having to wait until next Wednesday"</p>
    <p>I give 4o, o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnett and Deepseek the same prompts.</p>
    <p>In prompts releated to research, ChatGPT is the best by far, followed by DeepSeek. Claude is the worst but mainly because it can't search the internet. Without searching, DeepSeek takes the last place easily.</p>
    <p>In terms of writing and explaining Claude takes the cake, DeepSeek and ChatGPT are about par.</p>
    <p>In terms of code-related use cases, IMO Claude = Deepseek = o1 &gt; 4o</p>
    <p>I give Deepseek R1 a prompt or a pain point that needs a solution in R or Python, it gives me exactly what I need. o1 will give me what I need but may miss dependencies or skip some important steps and likes to overcomplicate things. Claude needs more handholding and multiple iterations, but it does the iterations better and overall tends to write more robust code than o1 and 4o. But again for me it needs more handholding.</p>
    <p>Deepseek just gives something workable, straight up, where ChatGPT may overly complicate and Claude overly simplify.</p>
    <p>True. Codes written by Deepseek is just better and typically just one shots it.</p>
    <p>it does i tested it on web development chat gpt 03 mini high could not do a better job then deepseekr1</p>
    <p>I don't know that one is "better" than the other. Though I currently have an ongoing "conversation" with both AI models. If I had to state in my opinion based off of these conversations which one was superior to the other, per deepseeks understanding ChatGpt reins supreme.</p>
    <p>Deepseek seems to often try and dodge questions and when a question was "maybe too complex" for it to provide an immediate it response it feigned a too busy server. Though immediately responded to my next comment of "really?" With a response to my initial question.</p>
    <p>Deepseek seems to explain things much more robotically, where chatgpt articulates more naturally, chatgpt also seems to generally be more objective to "what if" or philosophical type questions than deepseek in my expirience.</p>
    <p>Based on deepseeks own analysis of itself compared to chatgpt where it possibly excells is within its current level of customization, the degree to which I'm far from knowledgeable on.</p>
    <p>Anywho...yerp. this is just my thoughts on what I've observed so far, maybe like 4 hours in discussions with both systems though ive been using chatgpt for some time.</p>
    <p>It's better than any free ChatGPT model, and any Claude.</p>
    <p>I need the reasoning capabilities, mainly since it just writes better code.</p>
    <p>Also, I've got to admit. Seeing a bot think to itself just brings me joy. I knew all the way back in spring 2023 that this was the only way forward, and as usual - I was right.</p>
    <p>Oh my god, all the way back then??? Wow, you are such a visionary.</p>
    <p>FYI, you were already 6 months late to the party.</p>
    <p>i bet you are fun at parties and work</p>
    <p>As usual, I bet you're right!</p>
    <p>such a backward thinking reply to an opinionated answer,</p>
    <p> sir i bet u enjoy intellectual debates and thrive in the environment of philosophy, right?<lb/>it the guy's opinion , where tf does party and being fun comes from? </p>
    <p>deepseek is busy for me 90% of the time</p>
    <p>crowd attack</p>
    <p>It is not $200 per month better - if it's better at all. The only problem I have with Deep is image work but again, it's not worth $200 per month.</p>
    <p>Was wondering the same thing. This economy seems to all be based on astroturfing/propaganda. Musk ended up being a fraud on every account, coulda fooled me though. Money can buy people to write a book for you or shape your image any way you want. The way information travels and they way people are not able to confirm anything other than by consensus, sort of made way for manufactured consensus to be a very effective way to shape public opinion.</p>
    <p>The free version of chatgpt is seriously better if you compare them in parallel. Just ask them to explain a tweet you don't understand about a topic like 3D modeling or even a joke. You'll see.</p>
    <p>You just cant understand which model is better if they both are smarter than you and the only thing you are capable to ask is about "r" in "strawberry" or Tiananmen square.</p>
    <p>How many ‚Äúr‚Äù in Tiananmen square?</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>claude is still my preferred.</p>
    <p>There's ill will towards chatgpt and people want to see it fail. It's as simple as that, there's no objectivity at work.</p>
    <p>Yeah I don't understand either. I found ChatGPT to be better as well. Deepseek was neat in that it solved some issues differently which I appreciated. ChatGPT was still the winner in the end for me though.</p>
    <p>Not sure if people are necessarily saying deepseek is smarter. The buzz is over the claim that it is 10 to 20 times cheaper to run. Cheaper is not necessarily meaning saving 20$ a month, it means huge upside potential for improvement with current hardware, it means less impact in terms of energy consumption/pollution etc... And that is the big deal.</p>
    <p>The fact that it is almost as smart and is compared to chatgpt could be a win in itself when combined with the 20 times less effort to run.</p>
    <p>It's the opposite for me, chatgpt forgets memory and hallucinates every 2 seconds, I'm trying to learn a new language and all the exercises it makes are riddled with errors. Even after I somehow find the fix, it forgets it within 2 responses and reintroduces the error AGAIN.</p>
    <p>Deepseek on the other hand seems to do great so far, feels smarter and more reliable for code lessons compared to the urgent chatgpt. Idk something happened Jan 29th that destroyed the memory and logic in gpt and they haven't been able to revert back properly.</p>
    <p>It depends. If reasoning and innovation aren't your main criteria, then ChatGPT is definitely better. I'm a paid user, but its answers to some complex problems aren't great. On the other hand, DeepSeek not only solves those problems but also suggests efficient workarounds. If ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt improve soon, I might unsubscribe. I even requested DeepSeek to add memory and project management features, and I mentioned I‚Äôd be willing to pay for it</p>
    <p>when asking both ChatGPT and Deepseek calculus questions, Deepseek never got one wrong, and chatGPT failed consistantly on any integral that was more complex than the basics. Im sure eventually deepseek would make a mistake, but it certainly does better with math.</p>
    <p>Sure but is it ten squillion dollars better than Deepseek</p>
