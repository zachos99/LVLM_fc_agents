    <p>At this point it's less interesting to hear people deny the importance of climate change, but more interesting WHERE have they gotten their information from.</p>
    <p>I'm 100% some malicious disinformation op funded by fossil fuel money is beind a LOT of the non-scientific debate points.</p>
    <p>I remember 30 years ago as a child being able to take an ATV on snow covered and packed trail and crossing a well frozen lake to get to my dad's camp every winter. There hasn't been a winter in 15 - 20 years now that has been cold enough to do that. Even earlier to that in the 80s winter used to be cold with snow, now it's just a slush-a-thon, with freezing rain.</p>
    <p>I honestly find it depressing to read accounts, or watch footage, of a climate that no longer exists. Think how for thousands of years pretty much, you could usually rely on the weather to be roughly similar. The snow would usually come by this time of year. Or the last frost would usually be this time of year. Or the rains would come this tie of year. It would almost be comforting to know it followed a regular pattern.</p>
    <p>Now it's just "wait and see" each year.</p>
