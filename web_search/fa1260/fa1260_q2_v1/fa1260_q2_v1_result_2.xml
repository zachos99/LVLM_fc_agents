    <p>In the blustery Pyrenees mountains on Tuesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping had lunch with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. On the menu: everything from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Middle East crisis to trade, biodiversity and climate change.</p>
    <p>The setting was chosen to be relaxed and allow the two presidents to speak frankly. It was here that Macron spent childhoods in La Mongie, a village at 1,800 metres (5,905 feet) above sea level, where he and his wife Brigitte frequently ski.</p>
    <p>They were expected to discuss grounds for cooperation, such as environmental and climatic issues, and – according to media reports – attempt to thrash out more agreements to be added to the 37 intergovernmental accords signed on Monday.</p>
