    <p>“No cause justifies this violence.”</p>
    <p>In a statement, the national police denounced the “mindless violence, cowardly attacks” and stressed their determination to reinforce public order against “provocateurs and vandals”.</p>
    <p>Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said thugs looking for trouble had infiltrated the demonstrations.</p>
    <p>“Let there be no doubt: they are looking for violence and are there to sow chaos in Paris,” Mr Castaner said.</p>

    <p>Police used tear gas, water cannons and batons to push back protesters.</p>
    <p>Mr Castaner said there were more than 1,500 “ultra violent” people out looking for trouble.</p>
    <p>He said: “They decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack - and I use their words - Paris.</p>
    <p>“I’ve given instructions to the police this morning for great firmness so that nothing slips by."</p>
