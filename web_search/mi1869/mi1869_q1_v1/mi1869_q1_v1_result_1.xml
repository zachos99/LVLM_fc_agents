    <p>The Democratic National Convention is the formal event where Democrats from all 50 states and the U.S. territories will gather in Chicago to rally behind Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz, our Democratic nominees for President and Vice President of the United States. Democrats will celebrate our achievements under the Biden-Harris Administration and chart a path for the future. Primetime programming will be held at the United Center and other party activities will be conducted at the McCormick Place Convention Center, both planned in close coordination with the Chicago Host Committee, City of Chicago, State of Illinois, and the Democratic National Committee.</p>
    <p>The Democratic National Convention Committee (DNCC) is the convention arm of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), responsible for planning the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago from August 19-22, 2024.</p>
    <p>Chicago is the perfect place to bring the story of Vice President Harris, Governor Walz, and the Democratic Party to the American people. Chicago represents the diversity of the Democratic Party and the country. It’s a union city that sits at the heart of the Midwest, and it’s a Democratic stronghold that was part of the “blue wall” crucial to the Biden-Harris victory in 2020 and will be for a Harris-Walz victory in November. Across the city and entire region, Midwesterners are seeing the progress that is possible under Democratic leadership, including a manufacturing boom that has created good-paying jobs and uplifted communities who have been left behind.</p>
    <p>For delegates and non-delegates alike, the 2024 Democratic National Convention will present an incredible opportunity to be a part of history in the making. In addition to the over 5,000 delegates and alternates who will convene in Chicago this summer, 12,000 volunteers will help keep the convention running smoothly.</p>
    <p>People can also connect with the Democratic National Convention on social media. You can follow the DNCC on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter.</p>
    <p>We look forward to welcoming 50,000 total visitors to the city for the convention, including 5,000 delegates and alternates and 15,000 members of the media.</p>
    <p>The Democratic National Convention Committee will work with the 2024 Chicago Host Committee to ensure the DNC leaves a positive impact on neighborhoods and communities across Chicago. We expect to see an incredible economic impact across the Chicagoland area, benefiting the entire metro region, in line with the hundreds of millions of dollars past host cities have seen.</p>
    <p>The Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau found that the 2016 Democratic National Convention hosted in Philadelphia generated $230.9 million in total economic impact. An independent economic impact study concluded that the 2012 Democratic National Convention resulted in an estimated $163.6 million benefit to the Charlotte regional economy. After hosting the 2008 convention, Denver reported an estimated $266.1 million in regional economic benefit to Metro Denver, of which $153.9 million occurred within the City and County of Denver.</p>
    <p>Our sustainability advisors, Bright Beat and Purpose, are developing and implementing a sustainability program for the convention, including strategies that cut emissions, prevent waste, reuse materials, donate food, and more. These efforts will ensure this is the most sustainable Democratic National Convention in history. Learn more at demconvention.com/sustainability.</p>
    <p>The Chicago 2024 Host Committee launched its DNC Vendor Directory and Venue Map, which include more than 1,700 businesses and venues available for this summer’s Democratic National Convention.</p>
    <p>The vendor directory and venue map aim to connect the 50,000 delegates and other visitors to the wealth of local vendors available in Chicago leading up to, during, and after the Convention.</p>
    <p>The vendor directory and venue map are made up of Chicagoland businesses, individuals, and venues––of which more than 70% identified as diverse.</p>

    <p>If you have questions regarding the Vendor Interest Form, please contact vendors@Chicago2024.com.</p>
    <p>Only credentialed delegates, media, and guests can attend the convention in-person. We are building a convention to reach all Americans and will provide opportunities to participate.</p>
    <p>The DNCC highly encourages members of the Chicago community and beyond to participate in the convention by signing up to become a volunteer. Volunteer roles include supporting security, transportation, wayfinding, event staffing, technology, operations, communications, and more.</p>
    <p>People can also connect with the Democratic National Convention on social media. You can follow the DNCC on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X/Twitter.</p>
    <p>Are you hosting an event in Chicago for the 2024 Democratic National Convention?</p>
    <p>As we continue preparations for the convention, the DNCC is building a list of third-party events – breakfasts, luncheons, panels, receptions, happy hours, watch parties, late-night parties, and more. These events will start on Friday, August 16, and continue through Friday, August 23.</p>
    <p>This list of events will serve as a resource to delegates, elected officials, allied groups, partners, friends, and more who are traveling to Chicago for the DNC. If your event details are confirmed, please complete the form by Wednesday, July 17. We will continue to accept confirmed events on a rolling basis. Please use the same form through early August.</p>
    <p>Are you still looking for an event venue? If yes, please contact Marisol Aquino at marisol@chicago2024.com for assistance in identifying a venue that matches your needs.</p>

    <p>Note: We will only share events approved by the host(s) organization. Following are examples of what a public event might look like on the list:</p>
    <p>Thank you in advance for hosting an event and for contributing to all the festivities that will be taking place during the DNC.</p>
    <p>Please email: politicalandcoalitions@democonvention.com with any questions.</p>
    <p>Hotel allocations and reservations will be managed by the DNCC Housing Department who will remain in close touch with official state delegations and other stakeholders to understand and meet their housing needs for convention week.</p>
    <p>We have contracted thousands of hotel rooms at more than 40 properties around the city for delegates, alternates, media, and members of the Democratic family.</p>
    <p>All delegate hotels are located downtown within a five-mile radius of the United Center and/or McCormick Place.</p>
    <p>In addition to Chicago’s robust public transit options, the DNCC transportation team will coordinate buses and shuttles to ensure guests can easily travel between official convention locations.</p>
    <p>Official proceedings, primetime programming, and speeches will take place at the United Center, which has hosted 70 million guests since its opening in 1994, including the 1996 Democratic National Convention. Home to the Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bulls, the arena will host more than 200 events this year, including the convention.</p>
    <p>Official daytime party business, meetings, and briefings will be held at McCormick Place, North America’s largest convention center. Hotels on the McCormick Place campus will also serve as the headquarters hotel for Democratic staff and media. McCormick Place hosts more than 200 conferences each year that draw 1.8 million guests and create an estimated $1.8 billion in economic impact.</p>
    <p>In 2020, Democrats held a virtual convention – breaking new ground using technology, creativity, and ingenuity. Democrats produced programming that reached historic numbers of Americans and allowed more Americans than ever to participate in the convention in real and meaningful ways. In 2024, we are going to build on that success – reaching not only delegates in the United Center but people watching, gathering, and participating across the country.</p>
    <p>The Department of Homeland Security has designated both parties’ conventions as National Special Security Events (NSSEs), putting the U.S. Secret Service in charge of coordinating security efforts across federal, state, and local law enforcement, who have been working together since last August.</p>
    <p>The safety and security of convention delegates, guests, and the public is a top priority, and Chicago has a proven track record of hosting safe, large-scale events. The DNCC will continue to work closely with law enforcement partners and support them in their efforts to host a safe and secure convention, which includes planning for citizens expressing their First Amendment rights.</p>
    <p>The U.S. Secret Service is coordinating public safety efforts with the Chicago Police Department and Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC). More information on public safety efforts, including how the public can sign up for updates, is available at: Chicago.gov/OEMC.</p>
    <p>For specific security needs related to guests at official DNC events, please reach out to security@demconvention.com.</p>
    <p>The 2024 Democratic National Convention Committee adheres to current guidance from relevant public health authorities regarding COVID-19. Masking is not required at convention events, but any participant desiring to wear a mask is welcome to do so.</p>
    <p>The DNCC has added an Accessibility Advisor to their team in pursuit of its mission of hosting the most accessible Democratic National Convention in history. The Accessibility Advisor will work closely with the DNCC, Host Committee, United Center, McCormick Place, airports, hotels, and other venues as well as the Mayor’s Office for Persons with Disabilities and other key experts to ensure the physical infrastructure and material presented during the 2024 Democratic National Convention meets and exceeds all relevant accessibility standards.</p>
