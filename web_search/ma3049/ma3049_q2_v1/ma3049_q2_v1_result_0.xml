    <p>Irondragon Forge ClayWorks Posted June 18, 2024 Posted June 18, 2024 I ran across this You Tube video and couldn't stop watching it. Talk about rabbit holes. This is from the narrative. "Deep in the remote mountainous wilderness of Montana, we find this remarkable structure known as the Sage Wall. This imposing megalithic wonder is composed of massive polygonal granite stone blocks intricately stacked and aligned in a perfectly straight line. The Sage Wall's unique features, such as its straight lines and angular formations, set it apart from the natural geological formations commonly found in the region, connecting it with other sites commonly known as the Montana Megaliths."

    <p>Daswulf Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 This is really interesting to me as well. Doesn't look like a natural formation to me but I've never been there. I think there have been advanced civilizations far older than is normally thought. Advanced as in (at least) being able to work and move large stones and fit them with great precision. Quote</p>
    <p>Frosty Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 Looks pretty natural to me. Granite breaks in polygonal shapes or if it's internally competent large sheets as in the fatal rock fall on Half dome in Yosemite a few years ago. One strong clue the narrator dropped several times was referring to granite's horizontal sedimentation. Granite is igneous/metamorphic, (meta-igneous?) It's basically part of the mantel that rose closer to the surface because it's mostly silicious and lighter where it roasted for maybe a couple billion years to form the uniform micro crystalline structure. Another clue is the cover pic on the video. It is of another wall that does indeed appear to be of human origin down to (maybe) tool marks. It's just not the Sage Wall. I'd love to visit and talk to the folks who own it and especially take a look at the other similar granite formations in the area that were only glimpsed in the video. Color me really skeptical about it being an artefact. Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
    <p>George N. M. Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 There are several things that indicate that this is natural granite and not quarried blocks moved from somewhere else. First, in several places there are incipient joints parallel to the major joints. Those indicate that both formed in place and were not quarried and moved from another location. Second, there are instrusions (dikes) that cut across adjacent blocks. This does not happen in man made constructions. Also, as Frosty indicates the photo at the start of the video is not the Sage Wall. It is s megalithic wall from someplace else. Maybe Peru. Yes, it looks like it could be man made but granite can weather and do some interesting things that mimic human construction. The same is true for some other kinds of rocks, columnular basalt does not look natural. George the Geologist Quote</p>
    <p>BillyBones Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 One rock is about the same as any other to me. All i know about rocks is there are white ones, black ones, red ones, etc. That and it hurts to get hit with one no matter what color it is. That is pretty cool though, natural or not. We have some rock formations around here that look like bricks that were laid. If i took pictures i could provably convince people they were man made. I am like Das though, i beleive there were far more older civilizations than we know. Now i do not beleive all the lasers from pyramids and all that kind of jazz but i do think there were people that lived in villages, farmed, fished, etc. as a community rather than a bunch of people grunting in a cave. Humans have a collective memory of a flood that wiped out most of the life on Earth. Whether it was world wide or complete destruction or whatever i do not know but something obviously happened that had an impact on many, many generations. If humans were not civilized why would it have made such an impact? Something i do hate about stuff like that. Eventually some one has to come along and tell us how aliens helped. Always saying that we were not technologically advanced enough. I think that takes away so much from human ingenuity. I have seen people accomplish any task set forth. People always figure a way, especially when you are the third architect and if you dont, pharoh will lop off your head. I do like to read about stuff like that though but i am a skeptic at heart. Yes i think human civilizations go back much further than we currently know. But i do not beleive that pyramids were Atlantean power generators or landing pads for space craft. Quote</p>
    <p>Frosty Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 A collective memory of a flood eh? How's this one from 7,500 years bp. in one of the more heavily populated regions. Hmmm? https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180322112713.htm At the time that region was "the world" so drowning it did for the whole world. Aliens built everything I can't figure out how to. A mystery is easier to believe than it is cracking a book and learning things. I can't think of the guy's name with the wonky hair who had a TV show about ancient mysteries. I don't recall the name of the show but he became the poster child for the mystery over education trend. Seriously, popcorn is a mystery/miracle if you don't know how it works. Frosty The Lucky.

    <p>Frosty Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 I've been skimming scanning and reading for several hours about the Sage basin area. It is part of the basin and range formations of the Rockies dating roughly from the Cordilleran to Severien Orogony. Mountain building periods. The granite in the region is the basement rock that was uplifted during the collisions that caused the Rockies to rise. Ice sheets and melts over the last 66 million years caused the Rockies and heck the northern hemisphere to be compressed downwards under miles of ice and rebound when it melted. The New Madrid earthquake is currently believed to be the result of the current inter-glacial rebound. Granite isn't very flexible so it fractured where it was high enough in the crust to be hard. Through the fractures hot plastic granite and other stone, minerals, etc. were extruded forming granitic dikes. Erosion of the depositional material Sediments eroded and deposited in various low spots, basins, etc. has zero to do with the wall except to expose it as it's washed away. The narrator in the video's misuse of depositional in reference to the granite of the Sage wall is pretty solid evidence they haven't researched it nor the geology more than to increase tour sales. Heck, he had to come up with some lame theory to explain why the "back" side of the wall is filled nearly to the top with sediment. Oh wait, I didn't see an indication they ran GPR on that side to determine the depth, shape, etc. of the infill on the back side of the wall. What they're calling a dolmen AIN'T. 1st. there is no chamber to bury someone or hide anything, the granite slabs split, probably leaving the "cap" rock as the last remanent of what was covering it for the last 100 million years. The pan around shows the area covered with similar slabs, many laying flat. Gravity does that with large thin things. Nobody showed a pic between the slabs or they'd undoubtedly show closely matching faces. I'm going to stop reading geological and anthropology articles now. I WILL, I can stop any time I want to! Honest, I can. From what I've read I don't see any indication it was made by humans, which makes me happy. Not that I don't appreciate huge human works but moving and arranging stones this size almost certainly means slaves. Thanks for tipping us to this. I LOVE rock formations and the stories are worth reading/hearing for the entertainment of them. Frosty OUT! Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
    <p>George N. M. Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 The problem with the supposed "lost" or "unknown" civilizations is that they are often based on one thing, a pyramid, a wall, a "road", etc.. With no other supporting infrastructure like villages, burials, pottery, food storage sites, etc.. It takes a good sized work force to build large things and they have to be supported, even over years and generations and that leaves traces. Pre metal folk accomplished a lot of things, e.g. Incas, Mayas, Aztecs, Stonehenge, Gobolki Tepe, etc. and the Egyptian pyramid builders only had a few copper tools. Even the Gobolki Tepe folk may have been pre-agriculture, at least as we know it. And a structure has to have a purpose. A wall has to be part of a larger structure or be there to keep something out or in. The Sage Wall just seems to be on a random hillside. As with many things, extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. G Quote</p>
    <p>George N. M. Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 Frosty, if you want to look into some interesting geology look at Heart Mountain which is north of Cody, WY. There are a lot of wild theories on how it got to where it is. When searching you will probably come across a lot about the Heart Mountain "Relocation"/Concentration Camp where Japanese citizens were placed during WW2 which is nearby. Researching the geology may be a bit more complicated. G Quote</p>
    <p>Frosty Posted June 19, 2024 Posted June 19, 2024 Oh thank you VERY MUCH George! The first things a search turned up were images and while interesting I didn't see much THAT interesting about Heart Mountain. The geology of the displacement on the other hand defies description in any rational sense. Heart Mountain is one of many detached blocks that were displaced in the slide! I've drilled detached blocks in my old life, some the size of motor homes, one the size of an apartment building but those aren't sand compared to Heart Mountain. I mean HOLY MOLY that was a slide! I've only read one article and will probably have to read more but 450sq/miles, 5,000' thick moving estimated just sub-sonic speeds would've been heard in Alaska! Being on a 2% slope really has the voices chattering in my head. One of the questions the voices are asking is. I wonder how far the dust spread and can it be detected? I wonder about that because when I did here I pass through a few layers of volcanic ash, one from the recent 1986 eruption of Mt. Redoubt and one higher from the 96 Mt. Spur eruption. If I go to a spot not obscured by trees there are 3 "active" volcanoes and one big honking volcanic complex just over the mountains from us. By active they aren't erupting at present but they steam and rumble pretty steadily. If we swing around towards Valdez we spend about 2 hours driving time next to Mt. Wrangel volcanic complex and it's always smoking, puffing ash and some nights clouds glow red above it. One of the ash layers about 2' down is a good 2.5" thick and it's pretty compressed, the result of the 1912 Novarupta caldera eruption. Katmai is still smoking more than 100 years later. https://www.usgs.gov/news/impact-1912-novaruptakatmai-eruption-pacific-northwest Sorry about the side track but it makes me wonder how far and if the Heart Mountain dust went and if it can be detected. If I were younger it might be worth writing a grant proposal to hunt and see. One of the places Dad rented for his metal spinning shop was on the grounds of one of the WWII Japanese American interment camps in the San Fernando Valley. Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
    <p>George N. M. Posted June 20, 2024 Posted June 20, 2024 I told you that it was going to be wild. That's the kind of event that borders on catasrophism and is really hard to conceive of an event like this. The only thing similar that I know of is the north half of the island of Molokai sliding off into the ocean. G Quote</p>

I have an Inuit carving of a bear in green serpentine that I'm particularly fond of. Quote</p>
    <p>Frosty Posted June 20, 2024 Posted June 20, 2024 Molokai's long runout landslides were more catastrophic than the Heart Mountain slide and there's another volcanic island in the Canaries IIRC that does the same thing. Lava flows down the mountain, contacts the sea, cools and hangs there. The submarine slope is almost vertical in places and it's broken before. North Molokai might reach us here. We're about 450' elevation maybe 12 miles from Cook Inlet but if a wave driven by a long runout slide off Molokai might run right up the inlet. I've been fascinated by the Bretz Floods near the end of the last ice age 15,000-13,000 years BP. A lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet blocked the Clark Fork River at Missoula Montana damming Glacial lake Missoula IIRC the size of lakes Ontario and Erie combined. The problem being Ice makes a lousy dam and it broke a number of times, 40 IIRC. At the heights of the floods, Spokane would've been under 200' of 60mph. water. The Columbia gorge was carved largely by the floods from a wide river on the plateau to a gorge a four thousand feet deep and a few miles wide. I LOVE cruising the Channeled scablands of E. Wa. There are "sand" bars 400' high x 1/2 - 1 mile long with fine grains larger than a fist. Horseshoe falls was formed as a kolk formation not worn down as a water fall. The bedrock was literally ripped out of the ground by the flow and during it's height horse shoe falls weren't a water fall, just a dip in the flood. The tall wide regular hills you cross driving from the Cascades to Spokane are actually ripples like on the edge of a pond. I have no opinion about catastrophism, I'm not big on isms but catastrophes happened and will happen again. Back in the day I spent days in the channeled scablands, just like I did exploring the lava beds of California and Oregon. It's harder to "tour" the Columbia plateau but the Columbia river carved it's way down through exposing basalt bedrock 4,000' deep. These things happened and will again. There's nothing like standing at the base of some monumental geologic process to make a person feel humble. Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
    <p>George N. M. Posted June 20, 2024 Posted June 20, 2024 There are piles of rocks in Oregon's Willamette Valley south of Portland that are the result of icebergs floated along in the mega floods floating up the W. Valley, grounding, and melting in place when the water receded. Some of the rocks' origin sites are in Canada. G Quote</p>
    <p>BillyBones Posted June 20, 2024 Posted June 20, 2024 JHCC, that is pretty cool. Maybe a pic in the "curios and curiosities" thread is in order? The thing about "lost civilizations" where i differ is that i do not believe they were, for lack of a better term, advanced far enough to leave monolithic structures. More or less i think that human civilization goes back much further than what we believe it does. We left the caves and quit roaming as nomadic hunter gathers and formed communities much earlier than what most believe. I am pretty much a skeptic, i do not beleive that Atlanteans had lasers, I do not believe the pyramids were power generators, i do not beleive that India had electric machines, I do not beleive in giants or bigfoot or whatever, I do not beleive aliens are doing what ever, etc. I do love to read about all those things and the fringe theories, it is just fun like reading science fiction. That fuzzy haired guy on TV i have a love hate relationship with. Like i said i love stuff like that but i hate what he does. Which is another thing i dislike about the "lost civilization" people as is that they take away from human ingenuity. People who claim the Sphinx and the pyramids and thing like that predate the Egyptians are taking away from human ingenuity. Which is why i beleive that "lost civilizations" were not that advanced. Quote</p>
    <p>JHCC Posted June 20, 2024 Posted June 20, 2024 A lot depends on how you define "advanced". A lot of the major achievements of ancient civilizations (pyramids, etc) stand as monuments to how much can be accomplished with basic techniques applied in sophisticated ways by a LOT of people working VERY hard for a LONG time. People who can't imagine such things being accomplished without modern technology are merely betraying their own lack of imagination.

    <p>Frosty Posted June 20, 2024 Posted June 20, 2024 Glacial erratics are or were a fact of life, I have a granite boulder in the goat pen that ain't from around here. Then again we're on lodgement till running IIRC about 90'=/- down, or should I say -90' OG? I don't recall what erratics that are rafted in or on glacial ice are called. I've seen the ones in the Willamette Valley though there are places with more and larger but it's been to a while and I don't remember. I think we're pretty much on the same page Billy. I don't hang out at coffee shops like I used to but every one seems to have an evening or afternoon when what I call the foil beanie conspiracy club meets. There were times you'd think humans couldn't pick fruit or catch fish without ET help. I just put that back to the disturbing tendency of so many people's preference to believe in a mystery rather than learn how it works. Lazy. Frosty says John scores a BINGO! Egyptians kept pretty good records. One I remember from way back, jr. high ago I think, was of how ancient Egyptians and similar civilizations measured and laid out regular "perfect" geometrical buildings like pyramids using 3 tall straight sticks, knotted cords and ways to mark lines, corners, etc. Human beings are scary smart and if we want to do something we figure out a way. If extra terrestrials do start trying to influence or "civilize" us I feel for them. Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
    <p>Scott NC Posted June 24, 2024 Posted June 24, 2024 A bit late. I learned a lot from this topic, thank's Irondragon and others. So many rabbit holes, indeed. I don't think aliens came here to help build pyramids, or on a advanced technology spreading mission (well, maybe the Nazca Lines and Panama Canal). Though, maybe the Cyclops had a hand in building that wall..... https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopean_masonry Quote</p>
    <p>Frosty Posted June 24, 2024 Posted June 24, 2024 Isn't that a splendid rabbit warren of articles! Thanks Scott, I'll be thinking of you while my chores fall farther behind schedule. In a good way. Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
    <p>BillyBones Posted June 25, 2024 Posted June 25, 2024 I absolutely love The Farside. I still have 3 or 4 books of those cartoons. Even now thinking about cow tools make me laugh. Quote</p>
    <p>Frosty Posted June 25, 2024 Posted June 25, 2024 I'm with you Billy, The Farside is the first comic strip that thinks like I do. If that makes sense. One of my favorites from the early 70s. is a couple farmers talking over a fence and their dogs laying nearby. The word bubbles over the farmers reads, blah blah blah blah. The caption is. What dogs hear. I used to imagine playing puns with Gary Larsen. &lt;sigh&gt; Frosty The Lucky. Quote</p>
