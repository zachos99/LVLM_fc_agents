    <p>Shes probably one of the best asian actors today. Playing a mute character requires you to be more expressive and she does it incredibly well</p>
    <p>The woman who's the most emotional character in an insane popular tv show while being a fuckin mute can't act. Okay Sony. Have fun with concord round two.</p>
