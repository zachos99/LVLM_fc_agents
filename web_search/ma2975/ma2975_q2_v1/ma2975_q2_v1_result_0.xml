    <p>A woman arrested after praying outside an abortion clinic has received a payout from police.</p>
    <p>Isabel Vaughan-Spruce from Worcestershire was accused of breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) outside the clinic in Kings Norton, Birmingham, but the charges were dropped last year.</p>
    <p>She said her aim was to be "a peaceful and prayerful presence for women in crisis pregnancies".</p>
    <p>She received £13,000 from West Midlands Police, which said it settled her civil claim "without any admission of liability", adding the city council brought in the PSPO to deter protesters.</p>

    <p>Ms Vaughan-Spruce is co-director of March for Life UK, an anti-abortion campaign group.</p>
    <p>She claimed the police actions breached her human rights.</p>
    <p>The campaigner told the BBC that as a "crisis pregnancy support volunteer" for 20 years, she had offered leaflets about charitable services available to women who would rather avoid abortion.</p>
    <p>But she added she "found it particularly shocking" to be accused of "intimidating" action, as she "would condemn anyone who tries to intimidate or harass women".</p>
    <p>In addition, when she was arrested in November 2022, the centre was shut with no service users present, she said.</p>
    <p>"I was there simply to pray for women facing very difficult situations and decisions. Prayer isn’t a crime. Neither is standing," she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Vaughan-Spruce highlighted a survey about reproductive coercion, commissioned by the BBC, in which 15% of the 1,000 UK women surveyed said they had experienced pressure to terminate a pregnancy.</p>
    <p>She said women could face pressure from a partner or economic pressure, adding over the years she had helped dozens of women "who wanted to have other options than abortions available to them".</p>
    <p>The Home Office said: “Protecting women’s rights is a priority for this government, and it is vital anyone exercising their legal right to access abortion services is free from harassment and intimidation."</p>
    <head rend="h2">'Peaceful and prayerful'</head>
    <p>Father Sean Gough, a Catholic priest from Wolverhampton, also saw charges claiming he intimidated service users near the abortion clinic dropped in February 2023.</p>
    <p>Prosecutor Ekene Pruce said both cases were judged not to meet the full code test. This assesses whether prosecutions are in the public interest and if there is sufficient evidence.</p>
    <p>Ms Vaughan-Spruce received legal support from Alliance Defending Freedom UK (ADF), part of a US-based conservative Christian legal advocacy group, to fight her civil case.</p>
    <p>In the US, Alliance Defending Freedom appealed against a lower court ruling which led to the Arizona Supreme Court ruling the state can enforce a 160-year-old near-total ban on abortion.</p>
    <p>However, Ms Vaugh-Spruce told the BBC her focus outside the clinic in Birmingham "is not on legal change – but on being a peaceful and prayerful presence for women in crisis pregnancies".</p>
    <head rend="h2">Buffer zone legislation</head>
    <p>ADF UK has opposed government plans for buffer zones near abortion clinics which it said would mean a "further crackdown on silent prayer" and breach a protected right under the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
    <p>The Home Office said it had not yet set out the guidance but was "committed to introducing buffer zones around abortion clinics as soon as possible".</p>
    <p>The Daily Telegraph reported last week it understood the Home Office was considering banning silent prayer within the 150m zones.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Birmingham City Council confirmed its PSPO was still being enforced.</p>
    <p>West Midlands Police stated it was brought in in 2022 "to deter protesters and protect the public from intimidation that their presence causes following numerous complaints from residents".</p>
    <p>And regarding Ms Vaughan-Spruce's payment, the force added: "A member of the public who had been arrested on suspicion of breaching the PSPO subsequently made a civil claim for unlawful arrest, assault and a breach of their human rights.</p>
    <p>"We have now settled that claim without any admission of liability."</p>
    <p>It said it was continuing to liaise with the council and listen to the feedback from residents in the area.</p>
