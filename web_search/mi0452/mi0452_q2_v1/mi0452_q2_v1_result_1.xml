    <p>PocketCHIP (or "PocketC.H.I.P.") is a handheld computer produced by Next Thing Co. It is based on the CHIP platform, and includes a 480 x 272 LED backlit touchscreen and a membrane keyboard. The removable CHIP computer provides a 1 Ghz ARMv7 processor, 512 MB of RAM, wireless Internet, Bluetooth, one USB port, one headphone/video jack (a TRRS jack). PocketCHIP is powered by a 5-hour rechargeable battery.</p>
    <p>PocketCHIP includes a full version of PICO-8 preinstalled, tailored to the hardware to support using the touchscreen with the built-in editing tools (as a substitute for the mouse). You can use the wireless Internet connection with Splore to browse and play published carts.</p>
    <p>PocketCHIP (and CHIP) run the CHIP Operating System, which is based on Debian Linux. The CHIP includes GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins for building hardware extensions, and the PocketCHIP case extends these pins to through-hole pads along the top of the unit.</p>
    <p>PocketCHIP retails for $69 USD. As of June 2016, it is available for pre-order at the special price of $49 USD, shipping in July. The CHIP computer sells separately as a development platform for $9.</p>
    <p>CHIP and PocketCHIP originated as a Kickstarter campaign.</p>
