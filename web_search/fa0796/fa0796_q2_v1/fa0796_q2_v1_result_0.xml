    <head rend="h1"> How did medieval Europeans think of the Romans and their lost empire? </head>
    <p>I'm watching Vikings right now, and there is a scene where king Ecgberht is talking to one of his subjects, ~830 C.E. about some left over Roman art work, marveling at how advanced and glorious it seems compared to the art they can produce. They then discuss the Romans as if they were some incredible, advanced civilization able to "conquer the world".</p>
    <p>That made me curious. Ever since the renaissance, we in the western world have seen our knowledge increase from one generation to the next, technology has advanced along with our understanding of the universe through science. Our art has also grown more complex and varied. We don't know what it's like to look back into the past at a civilization more advanced than our own. The human race is more scientifically and technologically advanced now than it ever was before. In the west we've never been wealthier.</p>
    <p>But the middle ages are also called the 'dark ages' for a reason. The standard of living and technological capabilities of early medieval Europe were in many cases less than what existed at the height of the Roman empire. So what did Europeans think of the Romans? Did they revere them? Did they think of them as some kind of "lost civilization" with advanced technology? Did they have theories as to why their empire collapsed?</p>
    <p>I'm guessing the average peasant probably didn't know the Romans even existed, but the nobility must have, given all the artifacts and evidence left behind.</p>

    <p>All nobility from England to the Middle East practically worshiped the Romans. The size and power of the Empire at its peak must have been unimaginable at the time.</p>
    <p>It's worth remembering that we only have a lot of out Roman books because they were so frequently copied during the middle ages. Everyone wanted Roman books for what they did, whether it was manuals on math, art, architecture, military discipline, etc. It creates a substantial survival bias. Interestingly, Roman mythology stayed very popular the whole while.</p>
    <p>It's interesting that you picked the year 830 in particular, because that time marked a dramatic shift in thought. Before Charlemagne was crowned Roman Emperor, people would say the Empire was in decline. After, people started saying the Empire was gone.</p>
    <p>But the Empire still existed. The roman empire fell in 1453.</p>
    <p>That is one big and cool empire, WHY DOESN'T MINE LOOK LIKE THAT?!?</p>
    <p>I also have a question to build on this.</p>
    <p>What happened to the actual Romans that lived in Italy? Were they all killed in the Germanic expansion? Or did they move to the Eastern Roman Empire? Or did they stay in Italy and just live under "barbarian" rule?</p>
    <p>Some fled, but most stayed in Italy and lived under different governance.</p>
    <p>They're called Italians now.</p>
    <p>They stayed in Italy. Not that much changed for them, as barbarians had been slowly ruling more and more of it since the 3rd century. It's why the Byzantines precariously retaking Italy is a recurring theme in the early middle ages. The Romans were outside of the Roman Empire.</p>
    <p>Most stayed in Italy living under "barbarian" rule, which was true in France, Spain, and to a lesser extent North Africa. In these places, the ruling elite was Germanic and followed a separate set of laws, and often a different form of Christianity (Arianism) than the locals. This distinction gradually fizzled out in the 8th and 9th centuries when Roman identity became supplanted by a "Frankish" one, although the term Frank was more often used by Eastern Europeans and Middle Easterners to describe the Westerners, rather than a term used by Westerners themselves (for example, most Muslim sources from the First Crusade use "Frank" as a catch-all for all western Europeans). Regardless, the separate laws also started to fizzle out, as I believe the Carolingian Empire had one set of laws for everybody. This is partly because Germanic identity was being thrown off by the Franks in order to recapture the glory of Rome for PR purposes, as well as to legitimize the rule of Charlemagne in Western Europe.</p>
    <p>Even after the Renaissance, Europeans looked upon Rome as greater and more advanced. The Renaissance was basically about rediscovering the wisdom of the ancients. And Christianity often pointed to the fall of Rom and the fall of the western Roman Empire (and lesser state of Byzantium) as proof of a fallen world that was no longer as great as it once was.</p>
    <p>Rome had more than a million people in it during its peak. London didn't reach that until 1810. Well into the 1700s, people still thought Rome was better overall, despite knowing they did some things better, and it was really only around then that people began saying they might be better.</p>
    <p>So in the middle ages, the nobility was certainly aware of the Romans, and thought highly of them.</p>
    <p>The middle ages weren't as "backwards" as it is commonly thought, yes the West was in chaos for quite some time before and after the fall of Western Rome but soon the Franks would establish a new Western Roman Empire and many important and prosperous cities were founded all over the West, places that were called "Barbaric" were now centers of trade and culture, while the churches and monasteries became libraries of incredible amounts of knowledge, without them almost all our knowledge would have been lost, technological advancements were made in literally all aspects of life and many thinkers were trying to resolve the mysteries of the world, now with even more knowledge than before.</p>
    <p>In addition we have the Byzantines which continuesly saw themselves as Romans, their empire was very rich, diverse and advanced, just like it has always been, and Constantinople must have been very impressive.</p>
    <p>Overall the Holy Roman Empire was seen as the legitimate continuation of the Western Roman Empire while the Byzantines always saw themselves as Romans til the fall of Constantinople.</p>
    <p>question is how ppl percieved eastern roman empire, how much did they look up to them?</p>
    <p>I love those scenes with King Ecgberht in season 2. I thought the sort of medieval 'man of the enlightenment' made for a very compelling character.</p>
    <p>Anyway I've always wondered if the scene where Ecgberht's son says 'some say a race of giants used to live on this island' was inspired by this Saxon poem from the 8th century called 'The Ruin' https://eaglesanddragonspublishing.com/the-ruin-an-anglo-saxon-poem-of-the-past/</p>
    <p>The way Europeans thought about Roman times was pretty much dictated by the church. The fall of the empire happened rather quickly and the leftovers were immediately incorporated into whatever followed. Buildings were dismantled for their material or used by new occupants, roads either deteriorated or stayed in use while many military structures and fortifications just overgrew and rotted away. The legend of Rome persisted of course, but from a Christian point of view, heavily influenced by the church.</p>
    <p>Rome was of similiar importance to Christianity as Jerusalem and the leaders of the Holy Roman Empire all emphazised their alleged descendance from Rome(an emperors). This is a pretty rough summation, but if you're interested just read up on the Holy Roman Empire. It'll give you a pretty good impression what kind of blurred and glorified image medieval nobels had of Rome.</p>
    <p>The thing is the Romans had no technological advancement over the medieval period. The tech was exactly the same, Romans had huge logistical and financial advantages but no better tech and there is nothing they would have left behind to make a medieval person even concieve of a society existing with better technology. Improved technology just was not a concept possible at this point in history. Indeed if you look at medieval depictions of Roman figures they are all equipped and dressed in medieval clothing and tools. To them the world has never changed.</p>
    <p>Romans were considered military geniuses on the main a noble would read Vegetius and Caesar's commentaries for military education. The church used Caesar's commentaries abs Cicero's letters to teach Latin.</p>
    <p>There is one: Roman concrete. Multi-level houses and big structures got much more difficult to build. When they wanted to build churches, they had to invent whole new techniques.</p>
    <p>The early medievals didn’t have the organization to build big public works like the Romans, and I think some of the technologies involved were lost due to disuse.</p>
    <p>But the medievals did create new technology the Romans didn’t have, or didn’t have much of, like longships, water mills, and improved farming techniques.</p>
    <p>I hate this claim almost as much as "Dark Ages were stagnant".</p>
    <p>Roman technology was incredibly advanced for its time - in terms of methods of construction, in the utilization of mechanization of tasks, in organizational efficiency, and in the precision and specialization of tools. The Anglo-Saxons thought the ruins in Britain were the remains of walls built by giants rather than the work of intelligent men to sluice water to the cities; Roman works were awe-inspiring even in an increasingly ruined state. (See: The Ruin, Maxims II)</p>
    <p>The Early Middle Ages had a number of important developments, particularly in metallurgy and agriculture, that the Romans did not have - but to pretend that Rome was not, in many senses, more advanced than post-Roman Europe?</p>
    <p>Thank you for asking this question. I saw the same scene, was fascinated by it, and wondered the same thing: "Is this how medieval people thought of the Romans?"</p>
    <p>Bernard Cornwell describes this well in the Last Kingdom series of historical novels.</p>
    <p>They are told from first person point of view of the min character Uthred and whenever he sees Roman structures in Britain he usually has the same thoughts.</p>
    <p>He compares the huge Roman churches and houses to the crappy wooden buildings that the Saxons make. Sometimes he wonders if the Romans were giants (like giants in Norse mythology) since he can't figure out how else they build so well.</p>
    <p>Mostly, he ends with a pessimistic view of the Saxons. His logic is that people have declined since the Romans ruled Britain and therefore people and civilisation would continue to decline until the end of the world.</p>
    <p>They are great books, you should read them if you like the time period (but don't bother with the tv show).</p>
    <p>They saw Rome as the ultimate source of legitimacy and everyone wanted to emulate it. The word for Emperor in many languages is derived from Caesar(Kaiser, Tsar, etc.), basically every European empire claimed some sort of inheritance from Rome, the Russians called Moscow the "Third Rome", the popes saw themselves as the heirs to the "Pontifex Maximi" of Rome, etc.</p>
