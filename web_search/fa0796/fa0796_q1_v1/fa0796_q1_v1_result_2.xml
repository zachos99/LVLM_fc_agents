    <p>I absolutely love maps and I find it fascinating to watch in this video as the Roman empire rises and falls. To me seeing the events that I've read about and being able to see those events on a map really helps me place where things happened and I have a morbid love for watching the empire slowly fall apart.</p>
    <p>This video shows you how Rome was around for a long time before the Republic or the Empire. They were there pretty much minding their own business for about 400 years from mid 700's BC.</p>
    <p>Then a period of expansion from late 300's BC onward.</p>
    <p>If you accept the Byzantine Empire as an unbroken continuation of the Roman Empire, they hung on in the East for an amazingly long time, I watched the video with interest... especially when it got to the 600's AD (advent of Islam). I was expecting to see the Byzantines territory disappear rapidly under the advance of Islam.</p>
    <p>This happened, as expected, in Arabia and North Africa. But the Byzantines hung on to large tracts of their territory for centuries in Anatolia and Greece.</p>

    <p>This was made by EmperorTigerstar, a youtuber with a knack for making awesome history maps/timelines. Here's a much-watch he did for the territory lost/gained during WWII.</p>

    <p>Impressive.</p>
    <p>It's so sad, they could've 'civilized' the whole world a with some slightly better decisions</p>
    <p>Did you make the map/video?</p>
    <p>EmperorTigerstar did an amazing job with this.</p>
    <p>Man, it's crazy to see how often wars used to be waged and huge patches of land changing ownership every few years.</p>
    <p>What went on in rome and italy after rome became byzantine empire?</p>
    <p>Well, for anyone who plays Crusader Kings, it just goes to show you can conquer the known world by starting as an OPM.</p>
    <p>:)</p>
    <p>Why not continue for the rump states that held on as long as a decade after Constantinople fell? Morea and Theodoro come to mind.</p>
