    <p>Following the brand's ethos - Just Do It.</p>
    <p>Amazing &amp; Inspiring, I am wondering how he overcame all the pressure to switch or do something else, when all his peers were doing it, but he still refrained and stayed back. Hard work paid off. Thank you for sharing it.</p>
    <p>This is quiet common in our fatherâ€™s generation</p>
    <p>Thatâ€™s not a career, thatâ€™s a relationship ðŸ™Œ</p>
    <p>Embracing boredom, patience and persistence are brings unimaginable results.</p>
    <p>Awesome! Siva Sankaran see this!!!!</p>
    <p>It will be interesting to see what new ideas he can offer after having been associated with Nike for so long</p>
    <p>Great things take time!âœ¨ Sudharsanan Ganapathy</p>
