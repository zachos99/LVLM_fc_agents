Featuring a female protagonist, a new mountainous landscape to traverse, and all set in a new time period 300 years after the events of the first game.</p>\n    <p>Jump to:</p>\n    <list rend=\"ul\">\n      <item>When is it coming out?</item>\n      <item>Story details</item>\n      <item>Setting</item>\n      <item>Shuhei Yoshida's reaction</item>\n      <item>Development</item>\n    </list>\n    <head rend=\"h2\">Ghost of Yotei will be released on October 2 on PlayStation 5</head>\n    <p>Sony has confirmed that Ghost of Yotei will be released on October 2, 2025. Expect the game to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive at first, but as with big Sony titles like God of War Ragnarok and Horizon Zero Dawn, it will almost certainly get a PC release at some point in the future too.</p>\n    <head rend=\"h2\">Ghost of Yotei has a new protagonist</head>\n    <p>The Ghost of Tsushima sequel will start a new origin story with Atsu, a young woman seeking revenge. Details on her story are few and far between, but the trailer did reveal some interesting clues about the newest warrior to take on the mask of The Ghost.</p>\n    <p>For a start, Atsu can dual-wield katana, a talent that was never available to Jin Sakai in the first game. It could suggest that Atsu might prefer the direct approach to the stealthy methods that Jin could use to avoid and assassinate enemies. For all you accuracy fans out there, this detail actually lines up with historical records that suggest dual wielding wasn't a common practice in Japan during the time period in which Jin lived, but in Atsu's 17th-century world, the swordsman Miyamoto Musashi created the \"two heavens as one\" niten'ichi technique with two blades.</p>\n    <p>While some fans reacted with surprise at the gender of Ghost of Yotei's new samurai, female warriors called Onna-musha appeared in Japanese history as early as 1180.</p>\n    <p>The story also has its villains like the Yōtei Six — gang members protagonist Atsu has sworn to hunt down — as well a new gameplay mechanic that lets players \"glimpse Atsu’s past and understand everything that was taken from her.\"</p>\n    <p>\"16 years ago in the heart of Ezo (called Hokkaido in present day), a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six took everything from Atsu. They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito,\" said Sucker Punch senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb in a post on the PlayStation Blog.</p>\n    <p>\"One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.\"</p>\n    <head rend=\"h2\">There's a new setting for Ghost of Yotei</head>\n    <p>The name gives away the new setting for the game, but for those of us that skipped a few geography classes Yotei refers to Mount Yotei - translated somewhat unglamorously as \"sheep-hoof mountain\" - a volcano located in northern Japan. Specifically on Hokkaido, the second-biggest Japanese island, which would have been called Ezo in Atsu's time.</p>\n    <p>“When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves is ‘What is the DNA of a Ghost game?’” Creative Director Nate Fox told The New York Times. “It is about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan.” The Sucker Punch team visited a number of locations in Japan for research, including Shiretoko National Park where Fax made recordings of the ambient sounds to take back to the studio.</p>\n    <p>“Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears,” Fox said. “Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying. We strive to bring that into the video game — that feeling of danger.”</p>\n    <p>Ghost of Yotei is set in 1603, according to the PlayStation Blog. That's 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima and a period when Ezo was home to the indigenous Ainu people and still outside the control of Japan. Perhaps not coincidentally, 1603 is marked the Tokugawa shogunate becoming the government of Japan after the Battle of Sekigahara.</p>\n    <head rend=\"h2\">Former Sony exec Shuhei Yoshida swears it's \"even better\" than Ghost of Tsushima</head>\n    <p>\"Ghost of Tsushima felt incredible to play,\" Yoshida says in an interview with PlayStation Inside, \"and having played Ghost of Yotei at several stages of its development, I can assure you that it will be even better, and that Sucker Punch has done it again!\"</p>\n    <p>\"Japan is a difficult market for Western games, that’s true. But I don’t know if there’s a recipe as such. I think you need an understanding of Japan and its culture, especially for games like Ghost of Tsushima or Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which are set in the country and talk about its history\"</p>\n    <head rend=\"h2\">Ghost of Yotei is Sucker Punch's first game built completely for PS5</head>\n    <p>Ghost of Tsushima was notable for the way its incredible landscapes looked and felt as you explored the island, and it sounds as if we can expect the same from Ghost of Yotei.</p>\n    <p>\"This is also Sucker Punch’s first game built from the ground up for PlayStation 5, and we’re excited to build on the visual foundation we established in Ghost of Tsushima by making the world feel even more real,\" said Andrew Goldfarb, Senior Communications Manager at Sucker Punch Productions in a blog post.</p>\n    <p>\"We have massive sightlines that let you look far across the environment, whole new skies featuring twinkling stars and auroras, even more believable movement from wind on grass and vegetation, and more improvements we’ll share in the future. Our new setting also gives us the opportunity to introduce new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons.\"</p>\n  </main>\n  ",
