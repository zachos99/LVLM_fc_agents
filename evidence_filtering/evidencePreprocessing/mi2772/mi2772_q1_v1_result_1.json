  "text": "<main>\n    <p>With Ghost of Tsushima follow-up Ghost of Yotei set to feature new main character Atsu, many fans will want to know who voices them.</p>\n    <p>Ghost of Yotei was announced at the September 2024 State of Play showcase. While it is billed as a sequel to Sucker Punch’s 2020 samurai game Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei is set over 300 years after the events of that story. The original main character, Jin Sakai, voiced by Daisuke Tsuji, isn’t expected to make an appearance whatsoever.</p>\n    <p>Instead, Ghost of Yotei will feature a female samurai named Atsu, who has adopted Jin’s previous persona of the Ghost. Very little has been shared about the character and her personal story, but her voice actor was confirmed shortly after the game’s announcement.</p>\n    <head rend=\"h2\">Who is the voice of Atsu in Ghost of Yotei?</head>\n    <p>The voice of Atsu in Ghost of Yotei is Erika Ishii, who revealed their involvement with the sequel on Twitter.</p>\n    <p>While Ishii has lent their voice to a handful of movies and TV shows as well as a few live-action performances, they are probably best recognized from their video game performances. Some notable roles of theirs include Valkyrie in Apex Legends, Dr. Wenjie Evans in Deathloop, and Captain Amy Fang in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3’s Zombies mode.</p>\n    <p>Most recently, Ishii joined the cast of Mortal Kombat 1 as DLC fighter Sektor and they’re also set to appear in Dragon Age: The Veilguard as one of the voice options for player character Rook.</p>\n    <p>Some will instead recognize Ishii from their appearances in TTRPG web series, like LA by Night based on the Vampire: The Masquerade tabletop game and Dropout’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons show Dimension 20. They also made guest appearances on Critical Role during its third campaign.</p>\n    <p>For those who may prefer to play Ghost of Yotei in Japanese, there’s been no mention of who will voice Atsu in the Japanese dub.</p>\n    <p>Sony and Sucker Punch will likely pick a fairly well-known actor. In Ghost of Tsushima, protagonist Jin was voiced by Kazuya Nakai, a veteran of both anime and video games. His career is largely defined by his role as the voice of Roronoa Zoro in One Piece, a character he has been voicing since 1999. Some of his most famous roles include Shinjiro Aragaki in Persona 3 and Persona 3 Reload, and Gilgamesh in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and other installments in the series.</p>\n    <p>Because of this, fans can expect a big name to be attached to the Atsu voice actor role in Japan.</p>\n  </main>\n  ",
